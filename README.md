## Scrum Meeting
We follow  bi-weekly meetings on Mondays and Thursdays, each sprint starting from Mondays and lasting for two weeks. At the end of each sprint we had a retrospective meeting to look back on what went wrong and what went well. The retrospective captured in the Jira project-pages (attached screenshot of each sprint's retro document)

## XP Core Values
#### Communication:
We have a clear communication among us and the bi-weekly scrum calls helped majorly and if any person was not able to attend the same, they provided offline status update through Whatsapp. We worked together to ensure each one of us is aware of where the project stands and what is their responsibility as a team member.

#### Simplicity: 
We periodically ensure we are doing what is asked for and no more. We strive to keep the code base simpler and easier to be understood by everyone. We insert comments in places which need explanation. We refactor the code as and when needed to ensure the goal of simplicity is met and thereby debugging any issue that comes up should be simple.
